      CHAPTER THIRTY-FOURTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Hurricane.—A Forced Departure.—Loss of an Anchor.—Melancholy
      Reflections.—The Resolution adopted.—The Sand-Storm.—The
      Buried Caravan.—A Contrary yet Favorable Wind.—The Return
      southward.—Kennedy at his Post.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o’clock in the morning the wind was raging. It beat down with
      such violence that the Victoria could not stay near the ground without
      danger. It was thrown almost flat over upon its side, and the reeds chafed
      the silk so roughly that it seemed as though they would tear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We must be off, Dick,” said the doctor; “we cannot remain in this
      situation.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But, doctor, what of Joe?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I am not likely to abandon him. No, indeed! and should the hurricane
      carry me a thousand miles to the northward, I will return! But here we are
      endangering the safety of all.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Must we go without him?” asked the Scot, with an accent of profound
      grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And do you think, then,” rejoined Ferguson, “that my heart does not bleed
      like your own? Am I not merely obeying an imperious necessity?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I am entirely at your orders,” replied the hunter; “let us start!”
     </p>
    <p>
      But their departure was surrounded with unusual difficulty. The anchor,
      which had caught very deeply, resisted all their efforts to disengage it;
      while the balloon, drawing in the opposite direction, increased its
      tension. Kennedy could not get it free. Besides, in his present position,
      the manoeuvre had become a very perilous one, for the Victoria threatened
      to break away before he should be able to get into the car again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, unwilling to run such a risk, made his friend get into his
      place, and resigned himself to the alternative of cutting the anchor-rope.
      The Victoria made one bound of three hundred feet into the air, and took
      her route directly northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson had no other choice than to scud before the storm. He folded his
      arms, and soon became absorbed in his own melancholy reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments of profound silence, he turned to Kennedy, who sat
      there no less taciturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have, perhaps, been tempting Providence,” said he; “it does not belong
      to man to undertake such a journey!”—and a sigh of grief escaped him
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is but a few days,” replied the sportsman, “since we were
      congratulating ourselves upon having escaped so many dangers! All three of
      us were shaking hands!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Poor Joe! kindly and excellent disposition! brave and candid heart!
      Dazzled for a moment by his sudden discovery of wealth, he willingly
      sacrificed his treasures! And now, he is far from us; and the wind is
      carrying us still farther away with resistless speed!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Come, doctor, admitting that he may have found refuge among the lake
      tribes, can he not do as the travellers who visited them before us, did;—like
      Denham, like Barth? Both of those men got back to their own country.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! my dear Dick! Joe doesn’t know one word of the language; he is alone,
      and without resources. The travellers of whom you speak did not attempt to
      go forward without sending many presents in advance of them to the chiefs,
      and surrounded by an escort armed and trained for these expeditions. Yet,
      they could not avoid sufferings of the worst description! What, then, can
      you expect the fate of our companion to be? It is horrible to think of,
      and this is one of the worst calamities that it has ever been my lot to
      endure!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But, we’ll come back again, doctor!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Come back, Dick? Yes, if we have to abandon the balloon! if we should be
      forced to return to Lake Tchad on foot, and put ourselves in communication
      with the Sultan of Bornou! The Arabs cannot have retained a disagreeable
      remembrance of the first Europeans.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I will follow you, doctor,” replied the hunter, with emphasis. “You may
      count upon me! We would rather give up the idea of prosecuting this
      journey than not return. Joe forgot himself for our sake; we will
      sacrifice ourselves for his!”
     </p>
    <p>
      This resolve revived some hope in the hearts of these two men; they felt
      strong in the same inspiration. Ferguson forthwith set every thing at work
      to get into a contrary current, that might bring him back again to Lake
      Tchad; but this was impracticable at that moment, and even to alight was
      out of the question on ground completely bare of trees, and with such a
      hurricane blowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Victoria thus passed over the country of the Tibbous, crossed the
      Belad el Djerid, a desert of briers that forms the border of the Soudan,
      and advanced into the desert of sand streaked with the long tracks of the
      many caravans that pass and repass there. The last line of vegetation was
      speedily lost in the dim southern horizon, not far from the principal
      oasis in this part of Africa, whose fifty wells are shaded by magnificent
      trees; but it was impossible to stop. An Arab encampment, tents of striped
      stuff, some camels, stretching out their viper-like heads and necks along
      the sand, gave life to this solitude, but the Victoria sped by like a
      shooting-star, and in this way traversed a distance of sixty miles in
      three hours, without Ferguson being able to check or guide her course.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We cannot halt, we cannot alight!” said the doctor; “not a tree, not an
      inequality of the ground! Are we then to be driven clear across Sahara?
      Surely, Heaven is indeed against us!”
     </p>
    <p>
      He was uttering these words with a sort of despairing rage, when suddenly
      he saw the desert sands rising aloft in the midst of a dense cloud of
      dust, and go whirling through the air, impelled by opposing currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid this tornado, an entire caravan, disorganized, broken, and
      overthrown, was disappearing beneath an avalanche of sand. The camels,
      flung pell-mell together, were uttering dull and pitiful groans; cries and
      howls of despair were heard issuing from that dusty and stifling cloud,
      and, from time to time, a parti-colored garment cut the chaos of the scene
      with its vivid hues, and the moaning and shrieking sounded over all, a
      terrible accompaniment to this spectacle of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere long the sand had accumulated in compact masses; and there, where so
      recently stretched a level plain as far as the eye could see, rose now a
      ridgy line of hillocks, still moving from beneath—the vast tomb of
      an entire caravan!
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and Kennedy, pallid with emotion, sat transfixed by this
      fearful spectacle. They could no longer manage their balloon, which went
      whirling round and round in contending currents, and refused to obey the
      different dilations of the gas. Caught in these eddies of the atmosphere,
      it spun about with a rapidity that made their heads reel, while the car
      oscillated and swung to and fro violently at the same time. The
      instruments suspended under the awning clattered together as though they
      would be dashed to pieces; the pipes of the spiral bent to and fro,
      threatening to break at every instant; and the water-tanks jostled and
      jarred with tremendous din. Although but two feet apart, our aeronauts
      could not hear each other speak, but with firmly-clinched hands they clung
      convulsively to the cordage, and endeavored to steady themselves against
      the fury of the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennedy, with his hair blown wildly about his face, looked on without
      speaking; but the doctor had regained all his daring in the midst of this
      deadly peril, and not a sign of his emotion was betrayed in his
      countenance, even when, after a last violent twirl, the Victoria stopped
      suddenly in the midst of a most unlooked-for calm; the north wind had
      abruptly got the upper hand, and now drove her back with equal rapidity
      over the route she had traversed in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whither are we going now?” cried Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us leave that to Providence, my dear Dick; I was wrong in doubting
      it. It knows better than we, and here we are, returning to places that we
      had expected never to see again!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The surface of the country, which had looked so flat and level when they
      were coming, now seemed tossed and uneven, like the ocean-billows after a
      storm; a long succession of hillocks, that had scarcely settled to their
      places yet, indented the desert; the wind blew furiously, and the balloon
      fairly flew through the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The direction taken by our aeronauts differed somewhat from that of the
      morning, and thus about nine o’clock, instead of finding themselves again
      near the borders of Lake Tchad, they saw the desert still stretching away
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennedy remarked the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It matters little,” replied the doctor, “the important point is to return
      southward; we shall come across the towns of Bornou, Wouddie, or Kouka,
      and I should not hesitate to halt there.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “If you are satisfied, I am content,” replied the Scot, “but Heaven grant
      that we may not be reduced to cross the desert, as those unfortunate Arabs
      had to do! What we saw was frightful!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It often happens, Dick; these trips across the desert are far more
      perilous than those across the ocean. The desert has all the dangers of
      the sea, including the risk of being swallowed up, and added thereto are
      unendurable fatigues and privations.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I think the wind shows some symptoms of moderating; the sand-dust is less
      dense; the undulations of the surface are diminishing, and the sky is
      growing clearer.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “So much the better! We must now reconnoitre attentively with our glasses,
      and take care not to omit a single point.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I will look out for that, doctor, and not a tree shall be seen without my
      informing you of it.”
     </p>
    <p>
      And, suiting the action to the word, Kennedy took his station, spy-glass
      in hand, at the forward part of the car.
