			<h2>Thirty-Second</h2>
 <p>
 The Capital of Bornou.⁠—The Islands of the Biddiomahs.⁠—The
 Condors.⁠—The Doctor’s Anxieties.⁠—His Precautions.⁠—An
 Attack in Mid-air.⁠—The Balloon Covering torn.⁠—The Fall.⁠—Sublime
 Self-Sacrifice.⁠—The Northern Coast of the Lake.
 </p>
 <p>
 Since its arrival at Lake Tchad, the balloon had struck a current that
 edged it farther to the westward. A few clouds tempered the heat of the
 day, and, besides, a little air could be felt over this vast expanse of
 water; but about one o’clock, the Victoria, having slanted across this
 part of the lake, again advanced over the land for a space of seven or
 eight miles.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor, who was somewhat vexed at first at this turn of his course, no
 longer thought of complaining when he caught sight of the city of Kouka,
 the capital of Bornou. He saw it for a moment, encircled by its walls of
 white clay, and a few rudely-constructed mosques rising clumsily above
 that conglomeration of houses that look like playing-dice, which form most
 Arab towns. In the court-yards of the private dwellings, and on the public
 squares, grew palms and caoutchouc-trees topped with a dome of foliage
 more than one hundred feet in breadth. Joe called attention to the fact
 that these immense parasols were in proper accordance with the intense
 heat of the sun, and made thereon some pious reflections which it were
 needless to repeat.
 </p>
 <p>
 Kouka really consists of two distinct towns, separated by the “Dendal,” a
 large boulevard three hundred yards wide, at that hour crowded with
 horsemen and foot passengers. On one side, the rich quarter stands
 squarely with its airy and lofty houses, laid out in regular order; on the
 other, is huddled together the poor quarter, a miserable collection of low
 hovels of a conical shape, in which a poverty-stricken multitude vegetate
 rather than live, since Kouka is neither a trading nor a commercial city.
 </p>
 <p>
 Kennedy thought it looked something like Edinburgh, were that city
 extended on a plain, with its two distinct boroughs.
 </p>
 <p>
 But our travellers had scarcely the time to catch even this glimpse of it,
 for, with the fickleness that characterizes the air-currents of this
 region, a contrary wind suddenly swept them some forty miles over the
 surface of Lake Tchad.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then then were regaled with a new spectacle. They could count the numerous
 islets of the lake, inhabited by the Biddiomahs, a race of bloodthirsty
 and formidable pirates, who are as greatly feared when neighbors as are
 the Touaregs of Sahara.
 </p>
 <p>
 These estimable people were in readiness to receive the Victoria bravely
 with stones and arrows, but the balloon quickly passed their islands,
 fluttering over them, from one to the other with butterfly motion, like a
 gigantic beetle.
 </p>
 <p>
 At this moment, Joe, who was scanning the horizon, said to Kennedy:
 </p>
 <p>
 “There, sir, as you are always thinking of good sport, yonder is just the
 thing for you!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “What is it, Joe?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “This time, the doctor will not disapprove of your shooting.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “But what is it?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Don’t you see that flock of big birds making for us?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Birds?” exclaimed the doctor, snatching his spyglass.
 </p>
 <p>
 “I see them,” replied Kennedy; “there are at least a dozen of them.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Fourteen, exactly!” said Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Heaven grant that they may be of a kind sufficiently noxious for the
 doctor to let me peg away at them!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I should not object, but I would much rather see those birds at a
 distance from us!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Why, are you afraid of those fowls?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “They are condors, and of the largest size. Should they attack us⁠—”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, if they do, we’ll defend ourselves. We have a whole arsenal at our
 disposal. I don’t think those birds are so very formidable.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Who can tell?” was the doctor’s only remark.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ten minutes later, the flock had come within gunshot, and were making the
 air ring with their hoarse cries. They came right toward the Victoria,
 more irritated than frightened by her presence.
 </p>
 <p>
 “How they scream! What a noise!” said Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Perhaps they don’t like to see anybody poaching in their country up in
 the air, or daring to fly like themselves!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, now, to tell the truth, when I take a good look at them, they are
 an ugly, ferocious set, and I should think them dangerous enough if they
 were armed with Purdy-Moore rifles,” admitted Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “They have no need of such weapons,” said Ferguson, looking very grave.
 </p>
 <p>
 The condors flew around them in wide circles, their flight growing gradually
 closer and closer to the balloon. They swept through the air in rapid,
 fantastic curves, occasionally precipitating themselves headlong with the
 speed of a bullet, and then breaking their line of projection by an abrupt
 and daring angle.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor, much disquieted, resolved to ascend so as to escape this
 dangerous proximity. He therefore dilated the hydrogen in his balloon, and
 it rapidly rose.
 </p>
 <p>
 But the condors mounted with him, apparently determined not to part
 company.
 </p>
 <p>
 “They seem to mean mischief!” said the hunter, cocking his rifle.
 </p>
 <p>
 And, in fact, they were swooping nearer, and more than one came within
 fifty feet of them, as if defying the fire-arms.
 </p>
 <p>
 “By George, I’m itching to let them have it!” exclaimed Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “No, Dick; not now! Don’t exasperate them needlessly. That would only be
 exciting them to attack us!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “But I could soon settle those fellows!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “You may think so, Dick. But you are wrong!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Why, we have a bullet for each of them!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what
 would you do? How would you get at them? Just imagine yourself in the
 presence of a troop of lions on the plain, or a school of sharks in the
 open ocean! For travellers in the air, this situation is just as
 dangerous.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Are you speaking seriously, doctor?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Very seriously, Dick.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Let us wait, then!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Wait! Hold yourself in readiness in case of an attack, but do not fire
 without my orders.”
 </p>
 <p>
 The birds then collected at a short distance, yet to near that their naked
 necks, entirely bare of feathers, could be plainly seen, as they stretched
 them out with the effort of their cries, while their gristly crests,
 garnished with a comb and gills of deep violet, stood erect with rage.
 They were of the very largest size, their bodies being more than three
 feet in length, and the lower surface of their white wings glittering in
 the sunlight. They might well have been considered winged sharks, so
 striking was their resemblance to those ferocious rangers of the deep.
 </p>
 <p>
 “They are following us!” said the doctor, as he saw them ascending with
 him, “and, mount as we may, they can fly still higher!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, what are we to do?” asked Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor made no answer.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Listen, Samuel!” said the sportsman. “There are fourteen of those birds;
 we have seventeen shots at our disposal if we discharge all our weapons.
 Have we not the means, then, to destroy them or disperse them? I will give
 a good account of some of them!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I have no doubt of your skill, Dick; I look upon all as dead that may
 come within range of your rifle, but I repeat that, if they attack the
 upper part of the balloon, you could not get a sight at them. They would
 tear the silk covering that sustains us, and we are three thousand feet up
 in the air!”
 </p>
 <p>
 At this moment, one of the ferocious birds darted right at the balloon,
 with outstretched beak and claws, ready to rend it with either or both.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Fire! fire at once!” cried the doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
 He had scarcely ceased, ere the huge creature, stricken dead, dropped
 headlong, turning over and over in space as he fell.
 </p>
 <p>
 Kennedy had already grasped one of the two-barrelled fowling-pieces and
 Joe was taking aim with another.
 </p>
 <p>
 Frightened by the report, the condors drew back for a moment, but they
 almost instantly returned to the charge with extreme fury. Kennedy severed
 the head of one from its body with his first shot, and Joe broke the wing
 of another.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Only eleven left,” said he.
 </p>
 <p>
 Thereupon the birds changed their tactics, and by common consent soared
 above the balloon. Kennedy glanced at Ferguson. The latter, in spite of
 his imperturbability, grew pale. Then ensued a moment of terrifying
 silence. In the next they heard a harsh tearing noise, as of something
 rending the silk, and the car seemed to sink from beneath the feet of our
 three aeronauts.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We are lost!” exclaimed Ferguson, glancing at the barometer, which was
 now swiftly rising.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Over with the ballast!” he shouted, “over with it!”
 </p>
 <p>
 And in a few seconds the last lumps of quartz had disappeared.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We are still falling! Empty the water-tanks! Do you hear me, Joe? We are
 pitching into the lake!”
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe obeyed. The doctor leaned over and looked out. The lake seemed to come
 up toward him like a rising tide. Every object around grew rapidly in size
 while they were looking at it. The car was not two hundred feet from the
 surface of Lake Tchad.
 </p>
 <p>
 “The provisions! the provisions!” cried the doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
 And the box containing them was launched into space.
 </p>
 <p>
 Their descent became less rapid, but the luckless aeronauts were still
 falling, and into the lake.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Throw out something⁠—something more!” cried the doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
 “There is nothing more to throw!” was Kennedy’s despairing response.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Yes, there is!” called Joe, and with a wave of the hand he disappeared
 like a flash, over the edge of the car.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Joe! Joe!” exclaimed the doctor, horror-stricken.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Victoria thus relieved resumed her ascending motion, mounted a
 thousand feet into the air, and the wind, burying itself in the
 disinflated covering, bore them away toward the northern part of the lake.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Lost!” exclaimed the sportsman, with a gesture of despair.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Lost to save us!” responded Ferguson.
 </p>
 <p>
 And these men, intrepid as they were, felt the large tears streaming down
 their cheeks. They leaned over with the vain hope of seeing some trace of
 their heroic companion, but they were already far away from him.
 </p>
 <p>
 “What course shall we pursue?” asked Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Alight as soon as possible, Dick, and then wait.”
 </p>
 <p>
 After a sweep of some sixty miles the Victoria halted on a desert shore,
 on the north of the lake. The anchors caught in a low tree and the
 sportsman fastened it securely. Night came, but neither Ferguson nor
 Kennedy could find one moment’s sleep.
