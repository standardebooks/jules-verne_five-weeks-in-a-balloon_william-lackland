 </p>
 <p>
 The evening was lovely, and our three friends enjoyed it in the cool shade
 of the mimosas, after a substantial repast, at which the tea and the punch
 were dealt out with no niggardly hand.
 </p>
 <p>
 Kennedy had traversed the little domain in all directions. He had
 ransacked every thicket and satisfied himself that the balloon party were
 the only living creatures in this terrestrial paradise; so they stretched
 themselves upon their blankets and passed a peaceful night that brought
 them forgetfulness of their past sufferings.
 </p>
 <p>
 On the morrow, May 7th, the sun shone with all his splendor, but his rays
 could not penetrate the dense screen of the palm-tree foliage, and as
 there was no lack of provisions, the doctor resolved to remain where he
 was while waiting for a favorable wind.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe had conveyed his portable kitchen to the oasis, and proceeded to
 indulge in any number of culinary combinations, using water all the time
 with the most profuse extravagance.
 </p>
 <p>
 “What a strange succession of annoyances and enjoyments!” moralized
 Kennedy. “Such abundance as this after such privations; such luxury after
 such want! Ah! I nearly went mad!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “My dear Dick,” replied the doctor, “had it not been for Joe, you would
 not be sitting here, to-day, discoursing on the instability of human
 affairs.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Whole-hearted friend!” said Kennedy, extending his hand to Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 “There’s no occasion for all that,” responded the latter; “but you can
 take your revenge some time, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kennedy, always hoping though that you
 may never have occasion to do the same for me!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “It’s a poor constitution this of ours to succumb to so little,”
 philosophized <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson.
 </p>
 <p>
 “So little water, you mean, doctor,” interposed Joe; “that element must be
 very necessary to life.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Undoubtedly, and persons deprived of food hold out longer than those
 deprived of water.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I believe it. Besides, when needs must, one can eat any thing he comes
 across, even his fellow-creatures, although that must be a kind of food
 that’s pretty hard to digest.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “The savages don’t boggle much about it!” said Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Yes; but then they are savages, and accustomed to devouring raw meat;
 it’s something that I’d find very disgusting, for my part.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “It is disgusting enough,” said the doctor, “that’s a fact; and so much
 so, indeed, that nobody believed the narratives of the earliest travellers
 in Africa who brought back word that many tribes on that continent
 subsisted upon raw meat, and people generally refused to credit the
 statement. It was under such circumstances that a very singular adventure
 befell James Bruce.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Tell it to us, doctor; we’ve time enough to hear it,” said Joe,
 stretching himself voluptuously on the cool greensward.
 </p>
 <p>
 “By all means.⁠—James Bruce was a Scotchman, of Stirlingshire, who,
 between 1768 and 1772, traversed all Abyssinia, as far as Lake Tyana, in
 search of the sources of the Nile. He afterward returned to England, but
 did not publish an account of his journeys until 1790. His statements were
 received with extreme incredulity, and such may be the reception accorded
 to our own. The manners and customs of the Abyssinians seemed so different
 from those of the English, that no one would credit the description of
 them. Among other details, Bruce had put forward the assertion that the
 tribes of Eastern Africa fed upon raw flesh, and this set everybody
 against him. He might say so as much as he pleased; there was no one
 likely to go and see! One day, in a parlor at Edinburgh, a Scotch
 gentleman took up the subject in his presence, as it had become the topic
 of daily pleasantry, and, in reference to the eating of raw flesh, said
 that the thing was neither possible nor true. Bruce made no reply, but
 went out and returned a few minutes later with a raw steak, seasoned with
 pepper and salt, in the African style.
 </p>
 <p>
 “ ‘Sir,’ said he to the Scotchman, ‘in doubting my statements, you have
 grossly affronted me; in believing the thing to be impossible, you have
 been egregiously mistaken; and, in proof thereof, you will now eat this
 beef-steak raw, or you will give me instant satisfaction!’ The Scotchman
 had a wholesome dread of the brawny traveller, and <em>did</em> eat the steak,
 although not without a good many wry faces. Thereupon, with the utmost
 coolness, James Bruce added: ‘Even admitting, sir, that the thing were
 untrue, you will, at least, no longer maintain that it is impossible.’ ”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well put in!” said Joe, “and if the Scotchman found it lie heavy on his
 stomach, he got no more than he deserved. If, on our return to England,
 they dare to doubt what we say about our travels⁠—”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, Joe, what would you do?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Why, I’ll make the doubters swallow the pieces of the balloon, without
 either salt or pepper!”
 </p>
 <p>
 All burst out laughing at Joe’s queer notions, and thus the day slipped by
 in pleasant chat. With returning strength, hope had revived, and with hope
 came the courage to do and to dare. The past was obliterated in the
 presence of the future with providential rapidity.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe would have been willing to remain forever in this enchanting asylum;
 it was the realm he had pictured in his dreams; he felt himself at home;
 his master had to give him his exact location, and it was with the gravest
 air imaginable that he wrote down on his tablets fifteen degrees
 forty-three minutes east longitude, and eight degrees thirty-two minutes
 north latitude.
 </p>
 <p>
 Kennedy had but one regret, to wit, that he could not hunt in that
 miniature forest, because, according to his ideas, there was a slight
 deficiency of ferocious wild beasts in it.
 </p>
 <p>
 “But, my dear Dick,” said the doctor, “haven’t you rather a short memory?
 How about the lion and the lioness?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Oh, that!” he ejaculated with the contempt of a thorough-bred sportsman
 for game already killed. “But the fact is, that finding them here would
 lead one to suppose that we can’t be far from a more fertile country.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “It don’t prove much, Dick, for those animals, when goaded by hunger or
 thirst, will travel long distances, and I think that, to-night, we had
 better keep a more vigilant lookout, and light fires, besides.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “What, in such heat as this?” said Joe. “Well, if it’s necessary, we’ll
 have to do it, but I do think it a real pity to burn this pretty grove
 that has been such a comfort to us!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Oh! above all things, we must take the utmost care not to set it on
 fire,” replied the doctor, “so that others in the same strait as ourselves
 may some day find shelter here in the middle of the desert.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I’ll be very careful, indeed, doctor; but do you think that this oasis is
 known?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Undoubtedly; it is a halting-place for the caravans that frequent the
 centre of Africa, and a visit from one of them might be any thing but
 pleasant to you, Joe.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Why, are there any more of those rascally Nyam-Nyams around here?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Certainly; that is the general name of all the neighboring tribes, and,
 under the same climates, the same races are likely to have similar manners
 and customs.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Pah!” said Joe, “but, after all, it’s natural enough. If savages had the
 ways of gentlemen, where would be the difference? By George, these fine
 fellows wouldn’t have to be coaxed long to eat the Scotchman’s raw steak,
 nor the Scotchman either, into the bargain!”
 </p>
 <p>
 With this very sensible observation, Joe began to get ready his firewood
 for the night, making just as little of it as possible. Fortunately, these
 precautions were superfluous; and each of the party, in his turn, dropped
 off into the soundest slumber.
 </p>
 <p>
 On the next day the weather still showed no sign of change, but kept
 provokingly and obstinately fair. The balloon remained motionless, without
 any oscillation to betray a breath of wind.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor began to get uneasy again. If their stay in the desert were to
 be prolonged like this, their provisions would give out. After nearly
 perishing for want of water, they would, at last, have to starve to death!
 </p>
 <p>
 But he took fresh courage as he saw the mercury fall considerably in the
 barometer, and noticed evident signs of an early change in the atmosphere.
 He therefore resolved to make all his preparations for a start, so as to
 avail himself of the first opportunity. The feeding-tank and the
 water-tank were both completely filled.
 </p>
 <p>
 Then he had to reestablish the equilibrium of the balloon, and Joe was
 obliged to part with another considerable portion of his precious quartz.
 With restored health, his ambitious notions had come back to him, and he
 made more than one wry face before obeying his master; but the latter
 convinced him that he could not carry so considerable a weight with him
 through the air, and gave him his choice between the water and the gold.
 Joe hesitated no longer, but flung out the requisite quantity of his
 much-prized ore upon the sand.
 </p>
 <p>
 “The next people who come this way,” he remarked, “will be rather
 surprised to find a fortune in such a place.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens,
 eh?” suggested Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “You may be certain, Dick, that they would take him by surprise, and that
 he would publish his astonishment in several folios; so that some day we
 shall hear of a wonderful deposit of gold-bearing quartz in the midst of
 the African sands!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “And Joe there, will be the cause of it all!”
 </p>
 <p>
 This idea of mystifying some learned sage tickled Joe hugely, and made him
 laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
 During the rest of the day the doctor vainly kept on the watch for a
 change of weather. The temperature rose, and, had it not been for the
 shade of the oasis, would have been insupportable. The thermometer marked
 a hundred and forty-nine degrees in the sun, and a veritable rain of fire
 filled the air. This was the most intense heat that they had yet noted.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe arranged their bivouac for that evening, as he had done for the
 previous night; and during the watches kept by the doctor and Kennedy
 there was no fresh incident.
 </p>
 <p>
 But, toward three o’clock in the morning, while Joe was on guard, the
 temperature suddenly fell; the sky became overcast with clouds, and the
 darkness increased.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Turn out!” cried Joe, arousing his companions. “Turn out! Here’s the
 wind!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “At last!” exclaimed the doctor, eying the heavens. “But it is a storm!
 The balloon! Let us hasten to the balloon!”
 </p>
 <p>
 It was high time for them to reach it. The Victoria was bending to the
 force of the hurricane, and dragging along the car, the latter grazing the
 sand. Had any portion of the ballast been accidentally thrown out, the
 balloon would have been swept away, and all hope of recovering it have
 been forever lost.
 </p>
 <p>
 But fleet-footed Joe put forth his utmost speed, and checked the car,
 while the balloon beat upon the sand, at the risk of being torn to pieces.
 The doctor, followed by Kennedy, leaped in, and lit his cylinder, while
 his companions threw out the superfluous ballast.
 </p>
 <p>
 The travellers took one last look at the trees of the oasis bowing to the
 force of the hurricane, and soon, catching the wind at two hundred feet
 above the ground, disappeared in the gloom.
