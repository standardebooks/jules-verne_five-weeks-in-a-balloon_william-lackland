 CHAPTER SECOND.
 </h2>
 <p>
 The Article in the Daily Telegraph.⁠—War between the Scientific
 Journals.⁠—Mr. Petermann backs his Friend Dr. Ferguson.⁠—Reply
 of the Savant Koner.⁠—Bets made.⁠—Sundry Propositions offered to
 the Doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
 On the next day, in its number of January 15th, the Daily Telegraph
 published an article couched in the following terms:
 </p>
 <p>
 “Africa is, at length, about to surrender the secret of her vast
 solitudes; a modern OEdipus is to give us the key to that enigma which the
 learned men of sixty centuries have not been able to decipher. In other
 days, to seek the sources of the Nile⁠—fontes Nili quoerere⁠—was
 regarded as a mad endeavor, a chimera that could not be realized.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Dr. Barth, in following out to Soudan the track traced by Denham and
 Clapperton; Dr. Livingstone, in multiplying his fearless explorations from
 the Cape of Good Hope to the basin of the Zambesi; Captains Burton and
 Speke, in the discovery of the great interior lakes, have opened three
 highways to modern civilization. THEIR POINT OF INTERSECTION, which no
 traveller has yet been able to reach, is the very heart of Africa, and it
 is thither that all efforts should now be directed.
 </p>
 <p>
 “The labors of these hardy pioneers of science are now about to be knit
 together by the daring project of Dr. Samuel Ferguson, whose fine
 explorations our readers have frequently had the opportunity of
 appreciating.
 </p>
 <p>
 “This intrepid discoverer proposes to traverse all Africa from east to
 west IN A BALLOON. If we are well informed, the point of departure for
 this surprising journey is to be the island of Zanzibar, upon the eastern
 coast. As for the point of arrival, it is reserved for Providence alone to
 designate.
 </p>
 <p>
 “The proposal for this scientific undertaking was officially made,
 yesterday, at the rooms of the Royal Geographical Society, and the sum of
 twenty-five hundred pounds was voted to defray the expenses of the
 enterprise.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We shall keep our readers informed as to the progress of this enterprise,
 which has no precedent in the annals of exploration.”
 </p>
 <p>
 As may be supposed, the foregoing article had an enormous echo among
 scientific people. At first, it stirred up a storm of incredulity; Dr. Ferguson passed for a purely chimerical personage of the Barnum stamp,
 who, after having gone through the United States, proposed to “do” the
 British Isles.
 </p>
 <p>
 A humorous reply appeared in the February number of the Bulletins de la
 Societe Geographique of Geneva, which very wittily showed up the Royal
 Society of London and their phenomenal sturgeon.
 </p>
 <p>
 But Herr Petermann, in his Mittheilungen, published at Gotha, reduced the
 Geneva journal to the most absolute silence. Herr Petermann knew Dr. Ferguson personally, and guaranteed the intrepidity of his dauntless
 friend.
 </p>
 <p>
 Besides, all manner of doubt was quickly put out of the question:
 preparations for the trip were set on foot at London; the factories of
 Lyons received a heavy order for the silk required for the body of the
 balloon; and, finally, the British Government placed the transport-ship
 Resolute, Captain Bennett, at the disposal of the expedition.
 </p>
 <p>
 At once, upon word of all this, a thousand encouragements were offered,
 and felicitations came pouring in from all quarters. The details of the
 undertaking were published in full in the bulletins of the Geographical
 Society of Paris; a remarkable article appeared in the Nouvelles Annales
 des Voyages, de la Geographie, de l’Histoire, et de l’Archaeologie de M.
 V. A. Malte-Brun (“New Annals of Travels, Geography, History, and
 Archaeology, by M. V. A. Malte-Brun”); and a searching essay in the
 Zeitschrift fur Allgemeine Erdkunde, by Dr. W. Koner, triumphantly
 demonstrated the feasibility of the journey, its chances of success, the
 nature of the obstacles existing, the immense advantages of the aerial
 mode of locomotion, and found fault with nothing but the selected point of
 departure, which it contended should be Massowah, a small port in
 Abyssinia, whence James Bruce, in 1768, started upon his explorations in
 search of the sources of the Nile. Apart from that, it mentioned, in terms
 of unreserved admiration, the energetic character of Dr. Ferguson, and the
 heart, thrice panoplied in bronze, that could conceive and undertake such
 an enterprise.
 </p>
 <p>
 The North American Review could not, without some displeasure, contemplate
 so much glory monopolized by England. It therefore rather ridiculed the
 doctor’s scheme, and urged him, by all means, to push his explorations as
 far as America, while he was about it.
 </p>
 <p>
 In a word, without going over all the journals in the world, there was not
 a scientific publication, from the Journal of Evangelical Missions to the
 Revue Algerienne et Coloniale, from the Annales de la Propagation de la
 Foi to the Church Missionary Intelligencer, that had not something to say
 about the affair in all its phases.
 </p>
 <p>
 Many large bets were made at London and throughout England generally,
 first, as to the real or supposititious existence of Dr. Ferguson;
 secondly, as to the trip itself, which, some contended, would not be
 undertaken at all, and which was really contemplated, according to others;
 thirdly, upon the success or failure of the enterprise; and fourthly, upon
 the probabilities of Dr. Ferguson’s return. The betting-books were covered
 with entries of immense sums, as though the Epsom races were at stake.
 </p>
 <p>
 Thus, believers and unbelievers, the learned and the ignorant, alike had
 their eyes fixed on the doctor, and he became the lion of the day, without
 knowing that he carried such a mane. On his part, he willingly gave the
 most accurate information touching his project. He was very easily
 approached, being naturally the most affable man in the world. More than
 one bold adventurer presented himself, offering to share the dangers as
 well as the glory of the undertaking; but he refused them all, without
 giving his reasons for rejecting them.
 </p>
 <p>
 Numerous inventors of mechanism applicable to the guidance of balloons
 came to propose their systems, but he would accept none; and, when he was
 asked whether he had discovered something of his own for that purpose, he
 constantly refused to give any explanation, and merely busied himself more
 actively than ever with the preparations for his journey.
