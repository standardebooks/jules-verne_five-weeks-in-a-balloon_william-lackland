      CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Western Route.—Joe wakes up.—His Obstinacy.—End of
      Joe’s Narrative.—Tagelei.—Kennedy’s Anxieties.—The Route
      to the North.—A Night near Aghades.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night the wind lulled as though reposing after the
      boisterousness of the day, and the Victoria remained quietly at the top of
      the tall sycamore. The doctor and Kennedy kept watch by turns, and Joe
      availed himself of the chance to sleep most sturdily for twenty-four hours
      at a stretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s the remedy he needs,” said Dr. Ferguson. “Nature will take charge
      of his care.”
     </p>
    <p>
      With the dawn the wind sprang up again in quite strong, and moreover
      capricious gusts. It shifted abruptly from south to north, but finally the
      Victoria was carried away by it toward the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, map in hand, recognized the kingdom of Damerghou, an
      undulating region of great fertility, in which the huts that compose the
      villages are constructed of long reeds interwoven with branches of the
      asclepia. The grain-mills were seen raised in the cultivated fields, upon
      small scaffoldings or platforms, to keep them out of the reach of the mice
      and the huge ants of that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon passed the town of Zinder, recognized by its spacious place of
      execution, in the centre of which stands the “tree of death.” At its foot
      the executioner stands waiting, and whoever passes beneath its shadow is
      immediately hung!
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon consulting his compass, Kennedy could not refrain from saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look! we are again moving northward.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “No matter; if it only takes us to Timbuctoo, we shall not complain. Never
      was a finer voyage accomplished under better circumstances!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nor in better health,” said Joe, at that instant thrusting his jolly
      countenance from between the curtains of the awning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There he is! there’s our gallant friend—our preserver!” exclaimed
      Kennedy, cordially.—“How goes it, Joe?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! why, naturally enough, Mr. Kennedy, very naturally! I never felt
      better in my life! Nothing sets a man up like a little pleasure-trip with
      a bath in Lake Tchad to start on—eh, doctor?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Brave fellow!” said Ferguson, pressing Joe’s hand, “what terrible anxiety
      you caused us!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Humph! and you, sir? Do you think that I felt easy in my mind about you,
      gentlemen? You gave me a fine fright, let me tell you!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “We shall never agree in the world, Joe, if you take things in that
      style.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I see that his tumble hasn’t changed him a bit,” added Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your devotion and self-forgetfulness were sublime, my brave lad, and they
      saved us, for the Victoria was falling into the lake, and, once there,
      nobody could have extricated her.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But, if my devotion, as you are pleased to call my summerset, saved you,
      did it not save me too, for here we are, all three of us, in first-rate
      health? Consequently we have nothing to squabble about in the whole
      affair.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! we can never come to a settlement with that youth,” said the
      sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The best way to settle it,” replied Joe, “is to say nothing more about
      the matter. What’s done is done. Good or bad, we can’t take it back.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You obstinate fellow!” said the doctor, laughing; “you can’t refuse,
      though, to tell us your adventures, at all events.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Not if you think it worth while. But, in the first place, I’m going to
      cook this fat goose to a turn, for I see that Mr. Kennedy has not wasted
      his time.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “All right, Joe!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Well, let us see then how this African game will sit on a European
      stomach!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The goose was soon roasted by the flame of the blow-pipe, and not long
      afterward was comfortably stowed away. Joe took his own good share, like a
      man who had eaten nothing for several days. After the tea and the punch,
      he acquainted his friends with his recent adventures. He spoke with some
      emotion, even while looking at things with his usual philosophy. The
      doctor could not refrain from frequently pressing his hand when he saw his
      worthy servant more considerate of his master’s safety than of his own,
      and, in relation to the sinking of the island of the Biddiomahs, he
      explained to him the frequency of this phenomenon upon Lake Tchad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Joe, continuing his recital, arrived at the point where, sinking
      in the swamp, he had uttered a last cry of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought I was gone,” said he, “and as you came right into my mind, I
      made a hard fight for it. How, I couldn’t tell you—but I’d made up
      my mind that I wouldn’t go under without knowing why. Just then, I saw—two
      or three feet from me—what do you think? the end of a rope that had
      been fresh cut; so I took leave to make another jerk, and, by hook or by
      crook, I got to the rope. When I pulled, it didn’t give; so I pulled again
      and hauled away and there I was on dry ground! At the end of the rope, I
      found an anchor! Ah, master, I’ve a right to call that the anchor of
      safety, anyhow, if you have no objection. I knew it again! It was the
      anchor of the Victoria! You had grounded there! So I followed the
      direction of the rope and that gave me your direction, and, after trying
      hard a few times more, I got out of the swamp. I had got my strength back
      with my spunk, and I walked on part of the night away from the lake, until
      I got to the edge of a very big wood. There I saw a fenced-in place, where
      some horses were grazing, without thinking of any harm. Now, there are
      times when everybody knows how to ride a horse, are there not, doctor? So
      I didn’t spend much time thinking about it, but jumped right on the back
      of one of those innocent animals and away we went galloping north as fast
      as our legs could carry us. I needn’t tell you about the towns that I
      didn’t see nor the villages that I took good care to go around. No! I
      crossed the ploughed fields; I leaped the hedges; I scrambled over the
      fences; I dug my heels into my nag; I thrashed him; I fairly lifted the
      poor fellow off his feet! At last I got to the end of the tilled land.
      Good! There was the desert. ‘That suits me!’ said I, ‘for I can see better
      ahead of me and farther too.’ I was hoping all the time to see the balloon
      tacking about and waiting for me. But not a bit of it; and so, in about
      three hours, I go plump, like a fool, into a camp of Arabs! Whew! what a
      hunt that was! You see, Mr. Kennedy, a hunter don’t know what a real hunt
      is until he’s been hunted himself! Still I advise him not to try it if he
      can keep out of it! My horse was so tired, he was ready to drop off his
      legs; they were close on me; I threw myself to the ground; then I jumped
      up again behind an Arab! I didn’t mean the fellow any harm, and I hope he
      has no grudge against me for choking him, but I saw you—and you know
      the rest. The Victoria came on at my heels, and you caught me up flying,
      as a circus-rider does a ring. Wasn’t I right in counting on you? Now,
      doctor, you see how simple all that was! Nothing more natural in the
      world! I’m ready to begin over again, if it would be of any service to
      you. And besides, master, as I said a while ago, it’s not worth
      mentioning.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “My noble, gallant Joe!” said the doctor, with great feeling. “Heart of
      gold! we were not astray in trusting to your intelligence and skill.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Poh! doctor, one has only just to follow things along as they happen, and
      he can always work his way out of a scrape! The safest plan, you see, is
      to take matters as they come.”
     </p>
    <p>
      While Joe was telling his experience, the balloon had rapidly passed over
      a long reach of country, and Kennedy soon pointed out on the horizon a
      collection of structures that looked like a town. The doctor glanced at
      his map and recognized the place as the large village of Tagelei, in the
      Damerghou country.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here,” said he, “we come upon Dr. Barth’s route. It was at this place
      that he parted from his companions, Richardson and Overweg; the first was
      to follow the Zinder route, and the second that of Maradi; and you may
      remember that, of these three travellers, Barth was the only one who ever
      returned to Europe.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” said Kennedy, following out on the map the direction of the
      Victoria, “we are going due north.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Due north, Dick.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And don’t that give you a little uneasiness?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Why should it?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Because that line leads to Tripoli, and over the Great Desert.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, we shall not go so far as that, my friend—at least, I hope
      not.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But where do you expect to halt?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Come, Dick, don’t you feel some curiosity to see Timbuctoo?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Timbuctoo?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly,” said Joe; “nobody nowadays can think of making the trip to
      Africa without going to see Timbuctoo.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You will be only the fifth or sixth European who has ever set eyes on
      that mysterious city.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ho, then, for Timbuctoo!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, let us try to get as far as between the seventeenth and
      eighteenth degrees of north latitude, and there we will seek a favorable
      wind to carry us westward.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Good!” said the hunter. “But have we still far to go to the northward?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “One hundred and fifty miles at least.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “In that case,” said Kennedy, “I’ll turn in and sleep a bit.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sleep, sir; sleep!” urged Joe. “And you, doctor, do the same yourself:
      you must have need of rest, for I made you keep watch a little out of
      time.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The sportsman stretched himself under the awning; but Ferguson, who was
      not easily conquered by fatigue, remained at his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about three hours the Victoria was crossing with extreme rapidity an
      expanse of stony country, with ranges of lofty, naked mountains of
      granitic formation at the base. A few isolated peaks attained the height
      of even four thousand feet. Giraffes, antelopes, and ostriches were seen
      running and bounding with marvellous agility in the midst of forests of
      acacias, mimosas, souahs, and date-trees. After the barrenness of the
      desert, vegetation was now resuming its empire. This was the country of
      the Kailouas, who veil their faces with a bandage of cotton, like their
      dangerous neighbors, the Touaregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o’clock in the evening, after a splendid trip of two hundred and
      fifty miles, the Victoria halted over an important town. The moonlight
      revealed glimpses of one district half in ruins; and some pinnacles of
      mosques and minarets shot up here and there, glistening in the silvery
      rays. The doctor took a stellar observation, and discovered that he was in
      the latitude of Aghades.
    </p>
    <p>
      This city, once the seat of an immense trade, was already falling into
      ruin when Dr. Barth visited it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Victoria, not being seen in the obscurity of night, descended about
      two miles above Aghades, in a field of millet. The night was calm, and
      began to break into dawn about three o’clock A.M.; while a light wind
      coaxed the balloon westward, and even a little toward the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ferguson hastened to avail himself of such good fortune, and rapidly
      ascending resumed his aerial journey amid a long wake of golden morning
      sunshine.
