 The expedition upon the bank of the river had been sent by the governor of
 Senegal. It consisted of two officers, <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Dufraisse, lieutenant of
 marines, and Rodamel, naval ensign, and with these were a sergeant and
 seven soldiers. For two days they had been engaged in reconnoitring the
 most favorable situation for a post at Gouina, when they became witnesses
 of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson’s arrival.
 </p>
 <p>
 The warm greetings and felicitations of which our travellers were the
 recipients may be imagined. The Frenchmen, and they alone, having had
 ocular proof of the accomplishment of the daring project, naturally became
 <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson’s witnesses. Hence the doctor at once asked them to give
 their official testimony of his arrival at the cataracts of Gouina.
 </p>
 <p>
 “You would have no objection to signing a certificate of the fact, would
 you?” he inquired of Lieutenant Dufraisse.
 </p>
 <p>
 “At your orders!” the latter instantly replied.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Englishmen were escorted to a provisional post established on the bank
 of the river, where they found the most assiduous attention, and every
 thing to supply their wants. And there the following certificate was drawn
 up in the terms in which it appears today, in the archives of the Royal
 Geographical Society of London:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
 <p>
 “We, the undersigned, do hereby declare that, on the day herein mentioned,
 we witnessed the arrival of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson and his two companions, Richard
 Kennedy and Joseph Wilson, clinging to the cordage and network of a
 balloon, and that the said balloon fell at a distance of a few paces from
 us into the river, and being swept away by the current was lost in the
 cataracts of Gouina. In testimony whereof, we have hereunto set our hands
 and seals beside those of the persons hereinabove named, for the
 information of all whom it may concern.
 </p>

 <p>“Done at the Cataracts of Gouina, on the 24th of May, 1862.</p>

 <p>
 Here ended the astonishing journey of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson and his brave
 companions, as vouched for by undeniable testimony; and they found
 themselves among friends in the midst of most hospitable tribes, whose
 relations with the French settlements are frequent and amicable.
 </p>
 <p>
 They had arrived at Senegal on Saturday, the 24th of May, and on the 27th
 of the same month they reached the post of Medina, situated a little
 farther to the north, but on the river.
 </p>
 <p>
 There the French officers received them with open arms, and lavished upon
 them all the resources of their hospitality. Thus aided, the doctor and
 his friends were enabled to embark almost immediately on the small steamer
 called the <i>Basilic</i>, which ran down to the mouth of the river.
 </p>
 <p>
 Two weeks later, on the 10th of June, they arrived at Saint Louis, where
 the governor gave them a magnificent reception, and they recovered
 completely from their excitement and fatigue.
 </p>
 <p>
 Besides, Joe said to every one who chose to listen:
 </p>
 <p>
 “That was a stupid trip of ours, after all, and I wouldn’t advise anybody
 who is greedy for excitement to undertake it. It gets very tiresome at the
 last, and if it hadn’t been for the adventures on Lake Tchad and at the
 Senegal River, I do believe that we’d have died of yawning.”
 </p>
 <p>
 An English frigate was just about to sail, and the three travellers
 procured passage on board of her. On the 25th of June they arrived at
 Portsmouth, and on the next day at London.
 </p>
 <p>
 We will not describe the reception they got from the Royal Geographical
 Society, nor the intense curiosity and consideration of which they became
 the objects. Kennedy set off, at once, for Edinburgh, with his famous
 rifle, for he was in haste to relieve the anxiety of his faithful old
 housekeeper.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor and his devoted Joe remained the same men that we have known
 them, excepting that one change took place at their own suggestion.
 </p>
 <p>
 They ceased to be master and servant, in order to become bosom friends.
 </p>
 <p>
 The journals of all Europe were untiring in their praises of the bold
 explorers, and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> struck off an edition of three hundred
 and seventy-seven thousand copies on the day when it published a sketch of
 the trip.
 </p>
 <p>
 Doctor Ferguson, at a public meeting of the Royal Geographical Society,
 gave a recital of his journey through the air, and obtained for himself
 and his companions the golden medal set apart to reward the most
 remarkable exploring expedition of the year 1862.
 </p>
 <hr />
 <p>
 The first result of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson’s expedition was to establish, in the
 most precise manner, the facts and geographical surveys reported by
 <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Barth, Burton, Speke, and others. Thanks to the still more recent
 expeditions of <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Speke and Grant, De Heuglin and Muntzinger, who
 have been ascending to the sources of the Nile, and penetrating to the
 centre of Africa, we shall be enabled ere long to verify, in turn, the
 discoveries of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson in that vast region comprised between the
 fourteenth and thirty-third degrees of east longitude.
