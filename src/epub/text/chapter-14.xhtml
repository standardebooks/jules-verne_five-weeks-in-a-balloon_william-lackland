			<h2>Thirteenth</h2>
 <p>
 Change of Weather.⁠—Kennedy has the Fever.⁠—The Doctor’s
 Medicine.⁠—Travels on Land.⁠—The Basin of Imenge.⁠—Mount
 Rubeho.⁠—Six Thousand Feet Elevation.⁠—A Halt in the Daytime.
 </p>
 <p>
 The night was calm. However, on Saturday morning, Kennedy, as he awoke,
 complained of lassitude and feverish chills. The weather was changing. The
 sky, covered with clouds, seemed to be laying in supplies for a fresh
 deluge. A gloomy region is that Zungomoro country, where it rains
 continually, excepting, perhaps, for a couple of weeks in the month of
 January.
 </p>
 <p>
 A violent shower was not long in drenching our travellers. Below them, the
 roads, intersected by “nullahs,” a sort of instantaneous torrent, were
 soon rendered impracticable, entangled as they were, besides, with thorny
 thickets and gigantic lianas, or creeping vines. The sulphuretted hydrogen
 emanations, which Captain Burton mentions, could be distinctly smelt.
 </p>
 <p>
 “According to his statement, and I think he’s right,” said the doctor,
 “one could readily believe that there is a corpse hidden behind every
 thicket.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “An ugly country this!” sighed Joe; “and it seems to me that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kennedy
 is none the better for having passed the night in it.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “To tell the truth, I have quite a high fever,” said the sportsman.
 </p>
 <p>
 “There’s nothing remarkable about that, my dear Dick, for we are in one of
 the most unhealthy regions in Africa; but we shall not remain here long;
 so let’s be off.”
 </p>
 <p>
 Thanks to a skilful manoeuvre achieved by Joe, the anchor was disengaged,
 and Joe reascended to the car by means of the ladder. The doctor
 vigorously dilated the gas, and the Victoria resumed her flight, driven
 along by a spanking breeze.
 </p>
 <p>
 Only a few scattered huts could be seen through the pestilential mists;
 but the appearance of the country soon changed, for it often happens in
 Africa that some of the unhealthiest districts lie close beside others
 that are perfectly salubrious.
 </p>
 <p>
 Kennedy was visibly suffering, and the fever was mastering his vigorous
 constitution.
 </p>
 <p>
 “It won’t do to fall ill, though,” he grumbled; and so saying, he wrapped
 himself in a blanket, and lay down under the awning.
 </p>
 <p>
 “A little patience, Dick, and you’ll soon get over this,” said the doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Get over it! Egad, Samuel, if you’ve any drug in your travelling-chest
 that will set me on my feet again, bring it without delay. I’ll swallow it
 with my eyes shut!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Oh, I can do better than that, friend Dick; for I can give you a
 febrifuge that won’t cost any thing.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “And how will you do that?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Very easily. I am simply going to take you up above these clouds that are
 now deluging us, and remove you from this pestilential atmosphere. I ask
 for only ten minutes, in order to dilate the hydrogen.”
 </p>
 <p>
 The ten minutes had scarcely elapsed ere the travellers were beyond the
 rainy belt of country.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Wait a little, now, Dick, and you’ll begin to feel the effect of pure air
 and sunshine.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “There’s a cure for you!” said Joe; “why, it’s wonderful!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “No, it’s merely natural.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Oh! natural; yes, no doubt of that!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I bring Dick into good air, as the doctors do, every day, in Europe, or,
 as I would send a patient at Martinique to the Pitons, a lofty mountain on
 that island, to get clear of the yellow fever.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Ah! by Jove, this balloon is a paradise!” exclaimed Kennedy, feeling much
 better already.
 </p>
 <p>
 “It leads to it, anyhow!” replied Joe, quite gravely.
 </p>
 <p>
 It was a curious spectacle⁠—that mass of clouds piled up, at the
 moment, away below them! The vapors rolled over each other, and mingled
 together in confused masses of superb brilliance, as they reflected the
 rays of the sun. The Victoria had attained an altitude of four thousand
 feet, and the thermometer indicated a certain diminution of temperature.
 The land below could no longer be seen. Fifty miles away to the westward,
 Mount Rubeho raised its sparkling crest, marking the limit of the Ugogo
 country in east longitude thirty-six degrees twenty minutes. The wind was
 blowing at the rate of twenty miles an hour, but the aeronauts felt
 nothing of this increased speed. They observed no jar, and had scarcely
 any sense of motion at all.
 </p>
 <p>
 Three hours later, the doctor’s prediction was fully verified. Kennedy no
 longer felt a single shiver of the fever, but partook of some breakfast
 with an excellent appetite.
 </p>
 <p>
 “That beats sulphate of quinine!” said the energetic Scot, with hearty
 emphasis and much satisfaction.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Positively,” said Joe, “this is where I’ll have to retire to when I get
 old!”
 </p>
 <p>
 About ten o’clock in the morning the atmosphere cleared up, the clouds
 parted, and the country beneath could again be seen, the Victoria
 meanwhile rapidly descending. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson was in search of a current that
 would carry him more to the northeast, and he found it about six hundred
 feet from the ground. The country was becoming more broken, and even
 mountainous. The Zungomoro district was fading out of sight in the east
 with the last cocoa-nut-trees of that latitude.
 </p>
 <p>
 Ere long, the crests of a mountain-range assumed a more decided
 prominence. A few peaks rose here and there, and it became necessary to
 keep a sharp lookout for the pointed cones that seemed to spring up every
 moment.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We’re right among the breakers!” said Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Keep cool, Dick. We shan’t touch them,” was the doctor’s quiet answer.
 </p>
 <p>
 “It’s a jolly way to travel, anyhow!” said Joe, with his usual flow of
 spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
 In fact, the doctor managed his balloon with wondrous dexterity.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Now, if we had been compelled to go afoot over that drenched soil,” said
 he, “we should still be dragging along in a pestilential mire. Since our
 departure from Zanzibar, half our beasts of burden would have died with
 fatigue. We should be looking like ghosts ourselves, and despair would be
 seizing on our hearts. We should be in continual squabbles with our guides
 and porters, and completely exposed to their unbridled brutality. During
 the daytime, a damp, penetrating, unendurable humidity! At night, a cold
 frequently intolerable, and the stings of a kind of fly whose bite pierces
 the thickest cloth, and drives the victim crazy! All this, too, without
 saying any thing about wild beasts and ferocious native tribes!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I move that we don’t try it!” said Joe, in his droll way.
 </p>
 <p>
 “I exaggerate nothing,” continued Ferguson, “for, upon reading the
 narratives of such travellers as have had the hardihood to venture into
 these regions, your eyes would fill with tears.”
 </p>
 <p>
 About eleven o’clock they were passing over the basin of Imenge, and the
 tribes scattered over the adjacent hills were impotently menacing the
 Victoria with their weapons. Finally, she sped along as far as the last
 undulations of the country which precede Rubeho. These form the last and
 loftiest chain of the mountains of Usagara.
 </p>
 <p>
 The aeronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic
 conformation of the country. The three ramifications mentioned, of which
 the Duthumi forms the first link, are separated by immense longitudinal
 plains. These elevated summits consist of rounded cones, between which the
 soil is bestrewn with erratic blocks of stone and gravelly bowlders. The
 most abrupt declivity of these mountains confronts the Zanzibar coast, but
 the western slopes are merely inclined planes. The depressions in the soil
 are covered with a black, rich loam, on which there is a vigorous
 vegetation. Various water-courses filter through, toward the east, and
 work their way onward to flow into the Kingani, in the midst of gigantic
 clumps of sycamore, tamarind, calabash, and palmyra trees.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Attention!” said <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson. “We are approaching Rubeho, the name of
 which signifies, in the language of the country, the ‘Passage of the
 Winds,’ and we would do well to double its jagged pinnacles at a certain
 height. If my chart be exact, we are going to ascend to an elevation of
 five thousand feet.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Shall we often have occasion to reach those far upper belts of the
 atmosphere?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Very seldom: the height of the African mountains appears to be quite
 moderate compared with that of the European and Asiatic ranges; but, in
 any case, our good Victoria will find no difficulty in passing over them.”
 </p>
 <p>
 In a very little while, the gas expanded under the action of the heat, and
 the balloon took a very decided ascensional movement. Besides, the
 dilation of the hydrogen involved no danger, and only three-fourths of the
 vast capacity of the balloon was filled when the barometer, by a
 depression of eight inches, announced an elevation of six thousand feet.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Shall we go this high very long?” asked Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 “The atmosphere of the earth has a height of six thousand fathoms,” said
 the doctor; “and, with a very large balloon, one might go far. That is
 what <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Brioschi and Gay-Lussac did; but then the blood burst from
 their mouths and ears. Respirable air was wanting. Some years ago, two
 fearless Frenchmen, <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Barral and Bixio, also ventured into the very
 lofty regions; but their balloon burst⁠—”
 </p>
 <p>
 “And they fell?” asked Kennedy, abruptly.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Certainly they did; but as learned men should always fall⁠—namely,
 without hurting themselves.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, gentlemen,” said Joe, “you may try their fall over again, if you
 like; but, as for me, who am but a dolt, I prefer keeping at the medium
 height⁠—neither too far up, nor too low down. It won’t do to be too
 ambitious.”
 </p>
 <p>
 At the height of six thousand feet, the density of the atmosphere has
 already greatly diminished; sound is conveyed with difficulty, and the
 voice is not so easily heard. The view of objects becomes confused; the
 gaze no longer takes in any but large, quite ill-distinguishable masses;
 men and animals on the surface become absolutely invisible; the roads and
 rivers get to look like threads, and the lakes dwindle to ponds.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor and his friends felt themselves in a very anomalous condition;
 an atmospheric current of extreme velocity was bearing them away beyond
 arid mountains, upon whose summits vast fields of snow surprised the gaze;
 while their convulsed appearance told of Titanic travail in the earliest
 epoch of the world’s existence.
 </p>
 <p>
 The sun shone at the zenith, and his rays fell perpendicularly upon those
 lonely summits. The doctor took an accurate design of these mountains,
 which form four distinct ridges almost in a straight line, the
 northernmost being the longest.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Victoria soon descended the slope opposite to the Rubeho, skirting an
 acclivity covered with woods, and dotted with trees of very deep-green
 foliage. Then came crests and ravines, in a sort of desert which preceded
 the Ugogo country; and lower down were yellow plains, parched and fissured
 by the intense heat, and, here and there, bestrewn with saline plants and
 brambly thickets.
 </p>
 <p>
 Some underbrush, which, farther on, became forests, embellished the
 horizon. The doctor went nearer to the ground; the anchors were thrown
 out, and one of them soon caught in the boughs of a huge sycamore.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe, slipping nimbly down the tree, carefully attached the anchor, and the
 doctor left his cylinder at work to a certain degree in order to retain
 sufficient ascensional force in the balloon to keep it in the air.
 Meanwhile the wind had suddenly died away.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Now,” said Ferguson, “take two guns, friend Dick⁠—one for yourself
 and one for Joe⁠—and both of you try to bring back some nice cuts of
 antelope-meat; they will make us a good dinner.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Off to the hunt!” exclaimed Kennedy, joyously.
 </p>
 <p>
 He climbed briskly out of the car and descended. Joe had swung himself
 down from branch to branch, and was waiting for him below, stretching his
 limbs in the mean time.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Don’t fly away without us, doctor!” shouted Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Never fear, my boy!⁠—I am securely lashed. I’ll spend the time
 getting my notes into shape. A good hunt to you! but be careful. Besides,
 from my post here, I can observe the face of the country, and, at the
 least suspicious thing I notice, I’ll fire a signal-shot, and with that
 you must rally home.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Agreed!” said Kennedy; and off they went.
