 <p>
 On the 27th of May, at nine o’clock in the morning, the country presented
 an entirely different aspect. The slopes, extending far away, changed to
 hills that gave evidence of mountains soon to follow. They would have to
 cross the chain which separates the basin of the Niger from the basin of
 the Senegal, and determines the course of the watershed, whether to the
 Gulf of Guinea on the one hand, or to the bay of Cape Verde on the other.
 </p>
 <p>
 As far as Senegal, this part of Africa is marked down as dangerous. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ferguson knew it through the recitals of his predecessors. They had
 suffered a thousand privations and been exposed to a thousand dangers in
 the midst of these barbarous negro tribes. It was this fatal climate that
 had devoured most of the companions of Mungo Park. Ferguson, therefore,
 was more than ever decided not to set foot in this inhospitable region.
 </p>
 <p>
 But he had not enjoyed one moment of repose. The <i>Victoria</i> was descending
 very perceptibly, so much so that he had to throw overboard a number more
 of useless articles, especially when there was a mountain-top to pass.
 Things went on thus for more than one hundred and twenty miles; they were
 worn out with ascending and falling again; the balloon, like another rock
 of Sisyphus, kept continually sinking back toward the ground. The
 rotundity of the covering, which was now but little inflated, was
 collapsing already. It assumed an elongated shape, and the wind hollowed
 large cavities in the silken surface.
 </p>
 <p>
 Kennedy could not help observing this.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Is there a crack or a tear in the balloon?” he asked.
 </p>
 <p>
 “No, but the gutta percha has evidently softened or melted in the heat,
 and the hydrogen is escaping through the silk.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “How can we prevent that?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “It is impossible. Let us lighten her. That is the only help. So let us
 throw out every thing we can spare.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “But what shall it be?” said the hunter, looking at the car, which was
 already quite bare.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, let us get rid of the awning, for its weight is quite
 considerable.”
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe, who was interested in this order, climbed up on the circle which kept
 together the cordage of the network, and from that place easily managed to
 detach the heavy curtains of the awning and throw them overboard.
 </p>
 <p>
 “There’s something that will gladden the hearts of a whole tribe of
 blacks,” said he; “there’s enough to dress a thousand of them, for they’re
 not very extravagant with cloth.”
 </p>
 <p>
 The balloon had risen a little, but it soon became evident that it was
 again approaching the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Let us alight,” suggested Kennedy, “and see what can be done with the
 covering of the balloon.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I tell you, again, Dick, that we have no means of repairing it.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Then what shall we do?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “We’ll have to sacrifice every thing not absolutely indispensable; I am
 anxious, at all hazards, to avoid a detention in these regions. The
 forests over the tops of which we are skimming are any thing but safe.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “What! are there lions in them, or hyenas?” asked Joe, with an expression
 of sovereign contempt.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Worse than that, my boy! There are men, and some of the most cruel, too,
 in all Africa.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “How is that known?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “By the statements of travellers who have been here before us. Then the
 French settlers, who occupy the colony of Senegal, necessarily have
 relations with the surrounding tribes. Under the administration of Colonel
 Faidherbe, reconnaissances have been pushed far up into the country.
 Officers such as <abbr>Messrs.</abbr> Pascal, Vincent, and Lambert, have brought back
 precious documents from their expeditions. They have explored these
 countries formed by the elbow of the Senegal in places where war and
 pillage have left nothing but ruins.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “What, then, took place?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I will tell you. In 1854 a Marabout of the Senegalese Fouta, Al-Hadji by
 name, declaring himself to be inspired like Mohammed, stirred up all the
 tribes to war against the infidels⁠—that is to say, against the
 Europeans. He carried destruction and desolation over the regions between
 the Senegal River and its tributary, the Fatémé. Three hordes of fanatics
 led on by him scoured the country, sparing neither a village nor a hut in
 their pillaging, massacring career. He advanced in person on the town of
 Ségo, which was a long time threatened. In 1857 he worked up farther to
 the northward, and invested the fortification of Medina, built by the
 French on the bank of the river. This stronghold was defended by Paul
 Holl, who, for several months, without provisions or ammunition, held out
 until Colonel Faidherbe came to his relief. Al-Hadji and his bands then
 repassed the Senegal, and reappeared in the Kaarta, continuing their
 rapine and murder.⁠—Well, here below us is the very country in which
 he has found refuge with his hordes of banditti; and I assure you that it
 would not be a good thing to fall into his hands.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “We shall not,” said Joe, “even if we have to throw overboard our clothes
 to save the <i>Victoria</i>.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “We are not far from the river,” said the doctor, “but I foresee that our
 balloon will not be able to carry us beyond it.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Let us reach its banks, at all events,” said the Scot, “and that will be
 so much gained.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “That is what we are trying to do,” rejoined Ferguson, “only that one
 thing makes me feel anxious.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “What is that?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “We shall have mountains to pass, and that will be difficult to do, since
 I cannot augment the ascensional force of the balloon, even with the
 greatest possible heat that I can produce.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, wait a bit,” said Kennedy, “and we shall see!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “The poor <i>Victoria!</i>” sighed Joe; “I had got fond of her as the sailor does
 of his ship, and I’ll not give her up so easily. She may not be what she
 was at the start⁠—granted; but we shouldn’t say a word against her.
 She has done us good service, and it would break my heart to desert her.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Be at your ease, Joe; if we leave her, it will be in spite of ourselves.
 She’ll serve us until she’s completely worn out, and I ask of her only
 twenty-four hours more!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Ah, she’s getting used up! She grows thinner and thinner,” said Joe,
 dolefully, while he eyed her. “Poor balloon!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Unless I am deceived,” said Kennedy, “there on the horizon are the
 mountains of which you were speaking, doctor.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Yes, there they are, indeed!” exclaimed the doctor, after having examined
 them through his spyglass, “and they look very high. We shall have some
 trouble in crossing them.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Can we not avoid them?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “I am afraid not, Dick. See what an immense space they occupy⁠—nearly
 one-half of the horizon!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “They even seem to shut us in,” added Joe. “They are gaining on both our
 right and our left.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “We must then pass over them.”
 </p>
 <p>
 These obstacles, which threatened such imminent peril, seemed to approach
 with extreme rapidity, or, to speak more accurately, the wind, which was
 very fresh, was hurrying the balloon toward the sharp peaks. So rise it
 must, or be dashed to pieces.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Let us empty our tank of water,” said the doctor, “and keep only enough
 for one day.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “There it goes,” shouted Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Does the balloon rise at all?” asked Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “A little⁠—some fifty feet,” replied the doctor, who kept his eyes
 fixed on the barometer. “But that is not enough.”
 </p>
 <p>
 In truth the lofty peaks were starting up so swiftly before the travellers
 that they seemed to be rushing down upon them. The balloon was far from
 rising above them. She lacked an elevation of more than five hundred feet
 more.
 </p>
 <p>
 The stock of water for the cylinder was also thrown overboard and only a
 few pints were retained, but still all this was not enough.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We must pass them though!” urged the doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Let us throw out the tanks⁠—we have emptied them.” said Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Over with them!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “There they go!” panted Joe. “But it’s hard to see ourselves dropping off
 this way by piecemeal.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Now, for your part, Joe, make no attempt to sacrifice yourself as you did
 the other day! Whatever happens, swear to me that you will not leave us!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Have no fears, my master, we shall not be separated.”
 </p>
 <p>
 The <i>Victoria</i> had ascended some hundred and twenty feet, but the crest of
 the mountain still towered above it. It was an almost perpendicular ridge
 that ended in a regular wall rising abruptly in a straight line. It still
 rose more than two hundred feet over the aeronauts.
 </p>
 <p>
 “In ten minutes,” said the doctor to himself, “our car will be dashed
 against those rocks unless we succeed in passing them!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Well, doctor?” queried Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Keep nothing but our pemmican, and throw out all the heavy meat.”
 </p>
 <p>
 Thereupon the balloon was again lightened by some fifty pounds, and it
 rose very perceptibly, but that was of little consequence, unless it got
 above the line of the mountain-tops. The situation was terrifying. The
 <i>Victoria</i> was rushing on with great rapidity. They could feel that she
 would be dashed to pieces⁠—that the shock would be fearful.
 </p>
 <p>
 The doctor glanced around him in the car. It was nearly empty.
 </p>
 <p>
 “If needs be, Dick, hold yourself in readiness to throw over your
 firearms!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Sacrifice my firearms?” repeated the sportsman, with intense feeling.
 </p>
 <p>
 “My friend, I ask it; it will be absolutely necessary!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Samuel! Doctor!”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Your guns, and your stock of powder and ball might cost us our lives.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “We are close to it!” cried Joe.
 </p>
 <p>
 Sixty feet! The mountain still overtopped the balloon by sixty feet.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe took the blankets and other coverings and tossed them out; then,
 without a word to Kennedy, he threw over several bags of bullets and lead.
 </p>
 <p>
 The balloon went up still higher; it surmounted the dangerous ridge, and
 the rays of the sun shone upon its uppermost extremity; but the car was
 still below the level of certain broken masses of rock, against which it
 would inevitably be dashed.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Kennedy! Kennedy! throw out your firearms, or we are lost!” shouted the
 doctor.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Wait, sir; wait one moment!” they heard Joe exclaim, and, looking around,
 they saw Joe disappear over the edge of the balloon.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Joe! Joe!” cried Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Wretched man!” was the doctor’s agonized expression.
 </p>
 <p>
 The flat top of the mountain may have had about twenty feet in breadth at
 this point, and, on the other side, the slope presented a less declivity.
 The car just touched the level of this plane, which happened to be quite
 even, and it glided over a soil composed of sharp pebbles that grated as
 it passed.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We’re over it! we’re over it! we’re clear!” cried out an exulting voice
 that made Ferguson’s heart leap to his throat.
 </p>
 <p>
 The daring fellow was there, grasping the lower rim of the car, and
 running afoot over the top of the mountain, thus lightening the balloon of
 his whole weight. He had to hold on with all his strength, too, for it was
 likely to escape his grasp at any moment.

 <p>
 When he had reached the opposite declivity, and the abyss was before him,
 Joe, by a vigorous effort, hoisted himself from the ground, and,
 clambering up by the cordage, rejoined his friends.
 </p>
 <p>
 “That was all!” he coolly ejaculated.
 </p>
 <p>
 “My brave Joe! my friend!” said the doctor, with deep emotion.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Oh! what I did,” laughed the other, “was not for you; it was to save <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kennedy’s rifle. I owed him that good turn for the affair with the Arab! I
 like to pay my debts, and now we are even,” added he, handing to the
 sportsman his favorite weapon. “I’d feel very badly to see you deprived of
 it.”
 </p>
 <p>
 Kennedy heartily shook the brave fellow’s hand, without being able to
 utter a word.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <i>Victoria</i> had nothing to do now but to descend. That was easy enough,
 so that she was soon at a height of only two hundred feet from the ground,
 and was then in equilibrium. The surface seemed very much broken as though
 by a convulsion of nature. It presented numerous inequalities, which would
 have been very difficult to avoid during the night with a balloon that
 could no longer be controlled. Evening was coming on rapidly, and,
 notwithstanding his repugnance, the doctor had to make up his mind to halt
 until morning.
 </p>
 <p>
 “We’ll now look for a favorable stopping-place,” said he.
 </p>
 <p>
 “Ah!” replied Kennedy, “you have made up your mind, then, at last?”
 </p>
 <p>
 “Yes, I have for a long time been thinking over a plan which we’ll try to
 put into execution; it is only six o’clock in the evening, and we shall
 have time enough. Throw out your anchors, Joe!”
 </p>
 <p>
 Joe immediately obeyed, and the two anchors dangled below the balloon.
 </p>
 <p>
 “I see large forests ahead of us,” said the doctor; “we are going to sweep
 along their tops, and we shall grapple to some tree, for nothing would
 make me think of passing the night below, on the ground.”
 </p>
 <p>
 “But can we not descend?” asked Kennedy.
 </p>
 <p>
 “To what purpose? I repeat that it would be dangerous for us to separate,
 and, besides, I claim your help for a difficult piece of work.”
 </p>
 <p>
 The <i>Victoria</i>, which was skimming along the tops of immense forests, soon
 came to a sharp halt. Her anchors had caught, and, the wind falling as
 dusk came on, she remained motionlessly suspended above a vast field of
 verdure, formed by the tops of a forest of sycamores.
